# 66daysofdata
My #66daysofdata repo. Objective: Creating a complex recommendation system for whisky

Since I have never done any extensive work with natural language processing, I decided to scrape whisky reviews and develope a recommendation system based on similiar flavor, rating and budget. Since this is an after work/uni project I chose the #66daysofdata challenge to keep track of my advancements and share my results with you.

#Day 1: Text mining basics
I started this journey by signing into the course "Text Mining and Natural Language Processing in R" by Minerva Singh on Udemy to get familiar with text mining and NLP. Today I learned scraping html tables and cleaning the data.
