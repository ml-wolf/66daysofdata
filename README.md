# 66daysofdata
My #66daysofdata repo. Objective: Creating a complex recommendation system for whisky

Since I have never done any extensive work with natural language processing, I decided to scrape whisky reviews and develope a recommendation system based on similiar flavor, rating and budget. Since this is an after work/uni project I chose the #66daysofdata challenge to keep track of my advancements and share my results with you.

#Day 1: Text mining basics
I started this journey by signing into the course "Text Mining and Natural Language Processing in R" by Minerva Singh on Udemy to get familiar with text mining and NLP. Today I learned scraping html tables and cleaning the data.

#Day 2: Short html cleaning session
Today I just spent a couple of minutes on further cleaning operations for html tables with stringr.

#Day 3: Ground zero
Due to the inactuality of Minerva's course, and because of the absence of any help from her, I had to return it. So today I started a course on Datacamp, that suits my needs much better. After all I wanted to build my knowledge in NLP from the very beginning and this course covers the true fundamentals of text analysis such as regular expressions, tokenization, stop-words-removal and stemming. I am working night shift tonight, so i have a lot of time for studying on the side. 
#Update Day 3: 
Last night I made alot of progress. After getting familiar with the bag-of-words-representation, the typical vector representation, the tidytext representation and sparse matrices I learned about TFIDF matrices and Cosine Similarity and finished Chapter 2 of the course. Chapter 3 focuses on The data preparation for modeling. After a randomforest classification lateet dirichlet allocation was introduced and I stopped after the section on Beta- and Gamma-matrices.

#Day 4: Today I finished Chapter 3 with finalizing the LDA analysis with perplexity and other metrics and summarizing LDA results.

#Day 5: Just finished The Intro to NLP with R by completing Chapter 4 on advanced techniques. With this review of the fundamential knowledge NLP I can start my Analysis after I successfully scraped the reviews.
